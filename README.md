# Prediction, Explanation, and Control Under Free Exploration Learning: Experiment 2
This is a follow-up experiment with modified instruction at the learning phase and a preview of test tasks during the learning. During the learning phase, participants were occasionally presented with test questions that asked them to predict, control, or explain the chatbot's behavior (depending on their experimental condition) with an immediate feedback on their accuracy ("Correct" or "That's incorrect"). There were 5 questions in total. 

# Requirements
